Solanaroll is a fast, inexpensive dice game with a user-funded pooled treasury. 
The dice game is provably-fair and has a 1% house edge.

## Dice Game

The dice game uses a commit-reveal scheme: a reveal number hashed with the blockhash of the reveal number save transaction to obtain a random result.

## Pooled Treasury

Solanaroll allows users to fund the treasury and obtain treasury tokens that can be redeemed.
Similar to Serum Swap, your token allocation is pro-rated to the current treasury total funds.
If you deposit to the treasury and the treasury earns more SOL from game plays, your treasury tokens are worth more SOL.

## Play with any token (TODO)

Using Serum Swap, users will be able to swap any token to SOL before a game play, allowing users to play with any token.
